<div class="riddle"> <details> <summary>Universal Language</summary> <p class="answer">Mathematics is often referred to as the universal language because its principles and concepts are applicable and understandable across different cultures and countries. It provides a common framework for communication and understanding in the scientific and mathematical community.</p></details></div>
<div class="riddle"> <details> <summary>Zero as a Number</summary> <p class="answer">The concept of zero as a number was developed independently by different civilizations. It plays a crucial role in mathematical operations, such as place value, arithmetic, and calculus. The number zero was introduced to Europe by Arab mathematicians during the Middle Ages.</p></details></div>
<div class="riddle"> <details> <summary>Golden Ratio</summary> <p class="answer">The golden ratio, approximately equal to 1.618, is a mathematical proportion found in nature, art, and architecture. It is considered aesthetically pleasing and has been used in the design of famous structures, such as the Parthenon in Athens and the pyramids of Egypt.</p></details></div>
<div class="riddle"> <details> <summary>Infinite Numbers</summary> <p class="answer">There are different sizes of infinity in mathematics. For example, the set of all counting numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) is infinite, but the set of all real numbers (including decimals and fractions) is a larger infinity. Mathematician Georg Cantor developed the concept of different infinities.</p></details></div>
<div class="riddle"> <details> <summary>Pi (Ï€)</summary> <p class="answer">Pi is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction or a finite decimal. The value of pi is approximately 3.14159 and is used in various mathematical and scientific calculations.</p></details></div>
<div class="riddle"> <details> <summary>Fibonacci Sequence</summary> <p class="answer">The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...). This sequence appears in nature, such as in the arrangement of petals in a flower, the branching of trees, and the spiral pattern of shells.</p></details></div>
<div class="riddle"> <details> <summary>Symmetry</summary> <p class="answer">Symmetry is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It refers to a balanced arrangement of shapes or objects that are the same on both sides of a dividing line or point. Symmetry is found in geometric figures, art, and nature, and it plays a significant role in various branches of mathematics, such as geometry and group theory.</p></details></div>
